# Rock-Paper-Scissors-JS
A Rock Paper Scissors game played in your browser console, built using vanilla Javascript only.

# Background
A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for rock🪨, flat hand for paper📄, or their index and middle finger for scissors✄. But since the computer doesn't have fingers, you will be using the prompt to type rock, paper or scissors.
            The rules are :
            🔴 Rock crushes scissors
            🔴 Scissors cuts paper
            🔴 Paper covers rock
